## Introduction

Many boilermakers (past, current and aspiring) who are eager to get to the West Lafayette campus share a common concern: dreading the potential traffic between Indianapolis International Airport and Purdue University – West Lafayette campus (namely the Purdue Memorial Union). With ongoing construction, risk-taking wildlife, and anxiously-skilled drivers causing traffic buildup along highways such as I-65 and Sagamore Parkway, there is a need to appease drivers of their fears as they anticipate to take the route. This project addresses the need for accurate traffic predictions as engineered by the team via Google Cloud Platform. By analyzing both historical and live traffic data, we can provide eager Boilermakers and other users estimated traffic activity in order to help them make informed travel decision.


## Evidence

As highlighted in several news outlets, there continue to ongoing occurrences along the major artery roads between Indianapolis International Airport and Purdue’s West Lafayette campus. For example within the last year, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) mentioned several shutdowns along I-465 in an effort to finish the southwest side as part of the I-69 Finish Line project. Within the last few months, several incidents of car rollovers, collisions, and other fatal crashes plagued I-65. With many other factors in play, the need to find a more suitable route to navigate around such challenges is necessary. 

The evidence of such problems is manifested not only in the cited articles below, but also in the historical data that we retrieved. The traffic data provided by INDOT showcases traffic statistics over the years to help our team better understand trends in the area between our two end points of the targeted route. Thus, given the nature of such data as well as our initial statistical review of it, we see that we can rely on this data as a contributing factor to help compare routes to that are most desirable between Indianapolis International Airport and Purdue Memorial Union.


## Recommendation

Based on the given problem at hand, our team sees fit that we utilize the aforementioned historical data as well as the live data from Google maps in order to help us define to our users a more optimal route between the two locations. Thusly, we recommend that we utilize Google Cloud Platform technologies to help drive the ingestion and processing of our data. Furthermore, we recommend that we utilize live data being driven by API connection; the API to be considered is the Google Maps API. 

In addition, the use of prompt engineering is also critical for this project’s success. Our team decided that we will utilize both Bard and ChatGPT in order to facilitate our coding and directional needs. Using such tools will help us pull and integrate live data with our historical data to drive more refined and pointed outputs for user analysis.

With the orchestration of recommendations, we will be able to develop a refined model that will help “drive” decision making by providing options of comparison amongst the most optimal routes in order to navigate the challenges between the airport and PMU. Thus, any student, professor, alumni, or Boilermaker family members that intend to visit Purdue Pete or to go on a quick weekend getaway should not find trouble in getting between the two main locations in a timely manner.
